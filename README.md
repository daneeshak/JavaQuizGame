# Java IT Quiz Game

This is a simple multiple-choice quiz game focused on basic programming concepts in IT. The game was developed using Java and can be run from the command line.

## Prerequisites

To run the quiz game, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 8 or later)
- A command-line interface (CLI) such as Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal.

## How to Run the Game

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daneeshak/JavaQuizGame.git


 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Use your command-line interface (CLI) to navigate to the directory where the project is located:

    ```bash
    cd JavaQuizGame

3. **Compile the Java Code**

   Compile the ITQuizGame.java file using the javac command:

      ```bash
       javac Game_Quize.java

 Ths will generate a Game_Quize.class file in the same directory. The .class file is the compiled bytecode that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can execute.

4. **Run the Quiz Game**

    After compilation, you can run the quiz game using the java command:

    ```bash
    java Game_Quize

5. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**

     The quiz will prompt you for your group name, your name, NIC, student number, and batch. Then, it will proceed with 10 multiple-choice questions. Simply enter your answers (A, B, C, or D) when prompted.

6. **View Your Score:**

    At the end of the quiz, your score and a summary will be displayed, including the percentage and a final grade.

## Customization
You can customize the questions, answers, and other details by editing the ITQuizGame.java file. After making changes, be sure to recompile the code before running the game again.
